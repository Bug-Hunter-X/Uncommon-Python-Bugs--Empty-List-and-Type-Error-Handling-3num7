This repository demonstrates two common yet often overlooked errors in Python programming: the handling of empty lists and type errors during calculations.  The `bug.py` file showcases the errors, while `bugSolution.py` provides corrected code.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling and input validation for creating reliable and stable Python applications.
